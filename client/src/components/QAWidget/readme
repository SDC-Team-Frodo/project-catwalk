______________________________________________QA-READ-ME_______________________________________________________
Overview of my Widget:
The QA section contains a list of questions,
a search bar for looking up specific questions,
each questions has a list of answers that pertain to that question,
an answer can have pictures that are contained in the modal componant,
There are also two forms for adding a question and for adding an answer.

----------------------------------------------Widget.jsx-------------------------------------------------------
Description:
The widget.jsx is where everything starts. I have mounted in the QaContainer so this is the starting point
for the QA Widget.
State:
  data:
    this is the current data that is being rendered. It is an object that contains a list of questions. upon
    loading there will be a request sent to the API for a new list of questions based on the current product id.
    This is updated when the load function is invoked.
Context:
  ProductContext:
    useContext:
      This pulls the Product context passed in from app.jsx. The only thing that is used from this is
      the Id, which is used to make a request to the server for the questions.
  QALoadContext:
    Provider:
      This passes a load function down to all of the children so that when you need to re-render the
      questions all you have to do is useContext and then invoke it.
  QuestionsContext
    Provider:
      This passes the list of questions down to all of the children.
----------------------------------------------SearchBar.jsx----------------------------------------------------
Description:
The SearchBar is responsible for filtering the QuestionsContext based on the search function in the search.js.
it will only pass down the relevant questions to the children componants.
State:
  allQuestions:
    I store the QuestionsContext as a string here. This allowed me to watch for changes and have my
    useEffect work properly. For some reason when i was storing this state as an obfect instead of a string, it
    would turn into an empty object. This is updated when the QuestionsContext changes.
  relevantQuestions:
    This is where a store the filtered Questions. It allows me to only pass the filtered questions
    and since i'm storing allQuestions seperately i can still have access to the full list. This
    is updated when the search button is clicked.
  search:
    This is where i store what is actually in the searchBar. It is updated in the onChange function of the
    search input.
  searchClicked:
    Here i store weather or not the search button was clicked. Because of storing this in state i'm able to
    to update all the other state in a useEffect function that watches for searchClicked to be true. This is
    updated when the search button is clicked.
Context:
  QuestionsContext:
    useContext:
      this allows me to access all of the currently loaded questions data. I can then use this for my allQuestions
      State. When this changes everychild element will re-render.
    Provider:
      Here i pass down the relevant questions state. This allows for me to only give the filtered questions
      to the children so there is no chance of rendering the wrong questions.
----------------------------------------------QuestionList.jsx-------------------------------------------------
Description:
  This is where all of the questions passed down from the QuestionsContext are mapped and turned into componants.
  this also manages how many questions are supposed to be displayed, and holds the Modal that contains the
  QuestionForm, where a user can submit a new question.
State:
  allQuestions:
    This is where all of the questions that are passed from the QuestionsContext are stored in state. This is
    Changed when the QuestionsContext changes.
  displayedQuestions:
    This is where the amount of questions that are supposed to be displayed is stored. It stores a number that
    starts at 4 and will increment by two upon clicking the more questions button.
  questions:
    This is where i store the questions that need to be rendered on the screen. It's value is allQuestions sliced
    from 0 to the displayedQuestions number. It changes when the displayedQuestions changes.
  buttonDisplay:
    This stores a boolean that will determine if the more questions button should be rendered or not. It is true
    but becomes false when there are no more questions.
Context:
  QuestionsContext:
    useContext:
      This is where i get the full list of questions that need to ready to render.
